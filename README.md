Basic app for tracking to do's, based on udemy course:
https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-pl/

Ultimately, it is supposed to have an option to create tasks, with names, descriptions and optional deadlines, ability to mark them as done, and create groups of tasks.
Example: Task group "prepare for trip" with "buy tickets", "pack the bag" and "set the alarm clock" tasks. 
Additionally, it will have a Thymeleaf-based GUI
